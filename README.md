# Customer-Churn-Prediction-Vodafone-Corporation
A Machine Learning model that predicts if a customer will churn or not

## business Understanding
Customer churn is a critical challenge faced by Telecommunication companies, such as Vodafone Corporation.<br>In an increasingly competitive market, retaining customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.<br>Therefore, understanding and predicting customer churn has become a strategic priority for businesses aiming to enhance customer retention and maximize revenue.

This project aims to develop a predictive model to identify customers at risk of churning. By leveraging historical customer data and advanced machine learning techniques, we will uncover patterns and factors contributing to churn.<br>These insights will guide the development of proactive retention strategies, ensuring the business can mitigate churn effectively.
